React Counter Application
Project Description
This is a simple Counter Application built with React to demonstrate the use of useState hook for managing component state.

The application allows you to:
- Increment the counter by 1
- Decrement the counter by 1 (minimum value 0)
- Reset the counter to 0

The counter value updates dynamically on the UI, and the app uses CSS for styling with buttons in different colors:
Increment button → Green
Decrement button → Red
Reset button → Blue

A message “Minimum limit reached” is displayed when the counter is 0.
